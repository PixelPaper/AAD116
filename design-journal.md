Week 01
-------

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Atom](https://atom.io) and using the text in the attachment below render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. If you can, print off a copy of what you have created or save it for future reference.

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](http://pixelpaper.org/ixd/week01_markdown.zip) and, using the PDF as a guide reset the markdown_raw.rtf file in Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Atom.


Week 02
-------

Great to see everyone (almost) up and running on GitHub. Don't worry if you are still having problems getting your page up, we will get that sorted out next week. Tim's excellent [Hello World](https://github.com/timpotter/hello-world-page) tutorial will take you through the process and allow you to start personalising the content. We will look at changing the background next week so don’t worry of you can’t do that now.

Your first project for this module will be to get this page up and ruinning and write profile about you. Nothing huge just a few carefully crafted paragraphs introducing you and your work to the world and including links to relevent external sites (Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc). 

**Before putting pen to paper make sure you research how other designers approach their own self promotion.** Designers worth checking out are:
- [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/about.htm)
- [Craig Mod](http://craigmod.com/about)
- [Sarah Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/about)
- [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer)
- [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/about)

Make sure you research others, don't let the list above be your only source of material.

This, combined with your **research and work on the Markdown file** last week will equate to 20% of this modules mark. The completion date for this part of your coursework is **Friday 16th October**. Your work should be presented on your GitHub site (we will look at creating additional pages over the next week or two so don’t worry about where everything will go.

Week 03
-------

Your second project for this module is a group presentation looking at one of the topics listed below and delivered in front of the rest of the class. This project is worth 30% of the modules mark and will carry a high team-based mark so make sure you all participate fully. Peer review will be used to determine how each team member performed.

- Group 01 – Bauhaus and the New Typography
- Group 02 – Design Systems for the Olympic Games
- Group 03 – Pioneers of Digital Design
- Group 04 – Pioneers of Postmodern Graphic Design

A list of group members will be emailed to you. 

Research the topic fully, books, journals and the internet, to make sure your presentation is accurate

You can use Keynote or Powerpoint to make your presentation and each member of the team should talk on during the day.

Presentations will be delivered on Friday 30th October in 82D09 from 12.30 onwards. You will be marked on the day of the presentation and feedback will be offered to each team.

####Project 03 – Design Essay

For the final IxD project on AAD116 we would like to you write an essay of *no less than 2,000 words* on one of the designers listed below. 

Your essay should be well planned and researched before you start writing. Take a look at a few of the designers in question to see which one you wish to cover, you could add a paragraph on each at the beginning of your essay my means of an introduction.

Your final essay should be in the form of a single page website suitably illustrated with photographs and images of the designers work. You may want to consider designing your essay in the style of the designer chosen or you may wish to use your own approach.

This project equates to 50% of your final mark for this module. 10% of this will cover use of good grammar and spelling and another 10% will be given over to the final design.

You should write your essay with Markdown in the first instance. This will allow you to concentrate on the content and not concern your self with the coding. Once completed you can save it out to HTML and add some CSS loveliness.

- Jan Tschichold
- Paul Rand
- Massimo Vignelli
- Neville Brody
- Jessica Hische
- Paula Scher
- Wolfgang Weingart
- Stefan Sagmeister
- Michael Bierut
